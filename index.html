        <p>Hi there! I hope this message doesn't come across as too sudden. We crossed paths yesterday, but I've noticed you around SP and on campus before. I've been wanting to strike up a conversation, but nerves got the best of me. You might have seen meâ€” I was quite jittery when we finally talked. I have to be honest; you're the most stunning person I've come across, and those eyes of yours are truly captivating. Being around you makes me a bit nervous, in the best way possible. I apologize if this sounds a bit forward; the last thing I want is to come off as creepy.

            I understand you're likely occupied with your own commitments, and I appreciate your time. Despite that, I can't help but wonder if you'd be interested in going for a walk or dinner with me. You strike me as an intriguing person, and I'd love the chance to get to know you better. Of course, I completely respect your decision, and even the opportunity to chat with you has brought a smile to my face. ðŸ˜Š </p>

        function showPopup(response) {
            if (response === 'Yes') {
                alert("Thanks!!! ðŸ˜Š");
            }
        }

        function changePosition(response) {
            if (response === 'No') {
